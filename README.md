# Antique Alley | Kingston, ON

A modern, high-performance migration of the Antique Alley website. This project transitions the original static HTML/CSS/JS site into a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Tailwind CSS v4.

## 🏛️ Project Overview
Antique Alley is a hidden gem in downtown Kingston, Ontario, featuring over 5,000 square feet of antiques and collectibles. This version of the site provides a "snappy" user experience, a responsive gallery with a custom lightbox, and a theme tailored to the shop's classic aesthetic.
