            Located at the end of an alley way off of Wellington Street, most think we are a tiny shop, but once inside you will find over <strong>5,000 square feet</strong> of inventory. 
            We have an eclectic look and a very large inventory. A visit to the shop is a necessity.
          </p>

            Gayle or Gary will be glad to assist you in finding what you need, collect or just would love to own. 
            We welcome the opportunity to create the best shopping experience in antique hunting!
